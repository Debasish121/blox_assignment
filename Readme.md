## Question Overview

### 1. **Question:**  
  Elaborate what your internship or academic projects were?  
  a. What did the system do?  
  b. What other systems have you seen in the wild like that?  
  c. How do you approach the development problem?  
  d. What were interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow?  
  e. What did you learn from some very specific copy paste? Mention explicitly some of them.

- **Solution:**  
- I have answered the mandatory question in detail, explaining both my **academic project** and **internship experience**.
- The responses can be found in the **Question 1** folder, where I have provided two separate markdown files:
  - **academic.md**: Explains my academic project.
  - **internship.md**: Describes my internship experience at Upstox.

### 2. **Question:**  
  There is one database. Letâ€™s say it is hosted locally and one of the team members migrates it to AWS or GCP. How can one confirm that the copied data is the same as the original data? What would be the check points? Imagine that data from the table is of the form: List<Map<String, String>>

- **Solution:**  
- I have provided a solution to the question regarding data migration verification when migrating a database from a local server to AWS or GCP.
- The solution can be found in the **Question 2** folder:
  - **solution.js**: Implements the code to compare and verify the copied data between the original and cloud-hosted database.
  - **readme.md**: Contains an explanation of the solution and how to run the code.

### 3. **Question:**  
  Write a function to parse any valid JSON string into a corresponding Object, List, or Map object. You can use C, C++, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Python, Node. Note that the integer and floating point should be arbitrary precision.

- **Solution:**  
- I have written a function to parse a valid JSON string into a corresponding object, list, or map.
- The solution is located in the **Question 3** folder:
  - **solution.js**: Contains the implementation to parse JSON.
  - **readme.md**: Provides an explanation of the solution and how to run the code.
