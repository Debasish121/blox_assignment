# Internship Experience - Upstox

## Project Overview

As a **Software Development Engineer Intern** at **Upstox**, I worked on backend systems, including microservices, leveraging a tech stack that consisted of **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **SQL**. My focus was on improving performance, scalability, and system operations to ensure smooth functionality and enhance user experience.

### a. What did the system do?

The system I worked on was designed to handle and optimize customer support operations within Upstox's platform. It used **microservices** to manage various backend operations, including responding to user queries and requests. My contributions ensured that the system was scalable, optimized, and reliable for handling high loads of user traffic.

### b. What other systems have you seen in the wild like that?

Many systems in the financial and e-commerce sectors follow similar architectures, where **microservices** are used for scalability and performance. For instance, platforms like **PayPal** and **Amazon** utilize microservice-based backends to manage different functionalities (payments, inventory, user data) in a distributed manner. The **microservices architecture** also facilitates quick releases and minimal downtime during updates.

### c. How do you approach the development problem?

My approach involved thoroughly understanding the project requirements, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and designing solutions with an emphasis on **scalability** and **maintainability**. For backend components, I focused on optimizing performance by reviewing and refining **SQL queries** and microservice logic. I used **Spring Boot** for rapid development of robust APIs that enhanced performance, and I followed best practices for coding and documentation.

---

### d. What were interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow?

I frequently used **Stack Overflow** for optimizing **SQL queries** and solving specific **Java-related** issues, such as multi-threading problems and handling database connections efficiently. For instance, I found useful answers on optimizing **Spring Boot's caching mechanisms**.

---

### e. What did you learn from some very specific copy-paste?

One notable learning experience was when I copied a **multi-threading solution** for handling asynchronous requests in **Spring Boot**. The original code was very efficient in managing concurrency, but I had to adapt it to our projectâ€™s unique requirements. This taught me how to analyze solutions from the community critically and modify them to fit specific use cases. I also learned best practices for handling **database connections** and optimizing queries for better performance.
